  {
    question: 'Is the plan really free? What’s the catch?',
    answer: `It’s free. Tell me the job you want off your plate and I usually reply within ${CHECK_REPLY_TIME} with a plan and a fixed price. If it isn’t worth automating, I say so. No call, no automated sales emails, no obligation.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What do you actually build?',
    answer: 'Automation, connected tools and custom software for small businesses: enquiries gathered and answered, quotes and invoices that follow themselves up, reminders, shared customer records, internal tools, customer portals and websites with the system built in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: `Starter Automation is ${OFFERS[0].price} for one task from the automation menu, set up to run itself, with two one-day set-ups free. A Business System, where three jobs are joined up with a weekly report, starts from ${OFFERS[1].price.replace('From ', '')}. Custom Software starts from ${OFFERS[2].price.replace('From ', '')}. A Launch Page (one page that books, sells or takes enquiries) is ${getOffer('creator-launch').price}, and a Website (a Launch Page plus four more pages) starts from ${getOffer('website').price.replace('From ', '')}. Creators get the same prices: their Starter is comment-to-get-it. Every package includes free one-day set-ups. Care plans are ${CARE_PLANS[0].price} or ${CARE_PLANS[1].price}. No VAT added.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What can the ${OFFERS[0].price} Starter do?`,
    answer: `One task from the automation menu, set up to run itself on the tools you already use: missed-call text-back, appointment reminders, review requests, quote follow-up, payment reminders, online booking and more. Usually working within 7 working days of you adding me to your apps. ${STARTER_GUARANTEE}`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I buy an add-on on its own?',
    answer: `Add-ons go with a package, on the same invoice, so there are no surprise costs. One-day set-ups (small things like a review QR card, a quote template or your booking link added everywhere) come free with every package: two with a Starter, three with a Business System, and more are ${SETUP_PRICE} each. Anything that runs on its own is a task from the automation menu: the first is Starter Automation (${OFFERS[0].price}), and Extra automation (${getExtra('Extra automation').price}) adds another.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What isn’t included?',
    answer: `Paid apps or text-message costs, which you pay those companies directly (I tell you the cost up front). Changes after the 30-day tweaks window, unless you have a care plan (from ${CARE_PLANS[0].price}). And new features beyond the agreed plan, which get their own fixed price first.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take?',
    answer: `${DELIVERY_PROMISE} After it goes live you get ${CHANGES_WINDOW.short}, and anything not working as agreed is fixed free for 90 days.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How does payment work?',
    answer: `${PAYMENT_TERMS} Software subscriptions or text-message costs, if any, are paid by you directly at cost.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I own what you build?',
    answer: 'Yes. Every account stays yours. I never need your passwords; add me as a user, then remove me after.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if you’re ill or stop trading?',
    answer: 'Everything I build runs in accounts in your name, with a short written guide, so it keeps working without me. You can remove my access at any time, and anyone you choose can pick it up from the guide.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if an app I use changes or it stops working?',
    answer: `For 90 days after it goes live, anything I built that isn’t working the way we agreed is fixed free. If another company changes their app, that isn’t my build: I quote the fix first, or a care plan covers it. ${CHANGES_WINDOW.howItWorks}`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Am I tied in?',
    answer: `No. Every package is a one-off you own, with no contract. ${CARE_PLANS[0].name} (${CARE_PLANS[0].price}) and ${CARE_PLANS[1].name} (${CARE_PLANS[1].price}) are monthly, optional and can be cancelled any time.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What will the texts or apps cost each month?',
    answer: 'Paid apps and text-message costs are paid directly to the provider, not to me. I put the expected cost in your scope sheet before you pay, so there are no surprises. You own the accounts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this only for certain trades?',
    answer: 'No. If your business has customers, enquiries and admin, it fits: trades, salons, clinics, cafés, shops, agencies, charities and professional services, anywhere in the UK.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a new website?',
    answer: "Often not. Most of this works with the website and tools you already have. I'll say plainly if a new site or a custom system would genuinely help.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to book a call?',
    answer: "No. Send one line about the job with the form and I reply by email. Book the 15-minute call only if you'd rather talk it through.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work with what I already use?',
    answer: 'Yes. Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, spreadsheets, Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, Square, Fresha, Booksy, Xero, QuickBooks and most others. I build on what you have wherever practical.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you pay for referrals?',
    answer: `Yes, ${REFERRAL_REWARD} by bank transfer, no limit on how many. Introduce a business that isn't already talking to me and ask them to put your name in their first message. When they book any package and pay their first invoice, I send you ${REFERRAL_REWARD} within 7 days. Add-ons on their own and care plans don't count, and there's no reward if the job is cancelled or refunded. If you share this publicly, mention you're paid for referrals.`,
