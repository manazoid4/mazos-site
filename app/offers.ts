/**
 * The single source of truth for what Maz Works sells and what it costs.
 * Every page, the schema, the enquiry form and the tests read from here.
 * Never hard-code a price anywhere else.
 *
 * Positioning (Maz, 27 Sep 2026): Maz Works builds the systems small
 * businesses run on: automation, connected tools and custom software that win
 * customers and take admin off the owner. It is not a website-fix shop and not
 * a cheap web agency. Never describe it as "website repairs" or "small fixes".
 *
 * Offer v11 (2 Oct 2026, PROPOSED: prices need Maz's go before merge).
 * Built from the offer map and competitor teardown in the private handoff
 * folder `handoffs/2026-10-02-offer-v11/`. What changed and why:
 * - One fix ladder for every customer: Free plan £0 → One-day set-up £49 →
 *   Starter £149 → Business System from £595 → Custom from £2,450. A buyer
 *   picks their business type, sees their problems, then the step that fixes them.
 * - "Automation" is now a menu of 16 plain-English jobs (AUTOMATION_MENU).
 *   A Starter is one task from the menu; a Business System is three joined up
 *   plus the weekly report. No more guessing what automation means.
 * - Creators get their own two steps instead of three overlapping products:
 *   Creator Starter £149 (DM keyword → free resource → email list) and
 *   Creator Launch £595 (sales page + brand look + templates), replacing the
 *   £895 Sales Page, £595 Brand & Content Kit and £1,295 bundle.
 * - Prices came down (Starter £195→£149, System £795→£595, Custom £2,950→£2,450,
 *   Website £1,950→£1,495, Care £49/£195→£39/£149) because UK competitors sell
 *   missed-call text-back alone at ~£197 a month; we win on "own it once" and
 *   on visible value, not on being dear. Margin holds because every job is a
 *   templated recipe (docs/maz-works/OFFER-V11.md) and anything outside the
 *   menu is quoted or referred.
 * - Value that was always given but never shown is now on every card
 *   (ALWAYS_INCLUDED), plus five new items that cost ≤30 min per client
 *   once templated: walkthrough video, review QR card, 30-day check, written
 *   scope sheet before payment, and a Starter money-back guarantee.
 * - Still true from v10: 30 days of tweaks (two rounds) + 90-day fix promise,
 *   never "unlimited"; one invoice when the client has seen it working; jobs of
 *   £1,000+ billed in stages; never "half now, half later".
 *
 * Offer v12 (2 Oct 2026, PROPOSED in a draft PR: Maz merges to approve).
 * Same headline prices, clearer and more in each box (Maz: "creator pricing
 * and website pricing are completely different"; "a lot more value"):
 * - One ladder for everyone. Creators use the same steps as every business:
 *   Starter £149 (theirs is comment-to-get-it) and Launch Page £595.
 * - Pages add up: a Launch Page is one page; a Website is a Launch Page plus
 *   four more pages (same inclusions), so £1,495 is visibly less than
 *   £595 + 4 × £295.
 * - Every package includes free one-day set-ups (Starter 2, bigger packages 3),
 *   because those are the items free tools and £30 gigs undercut on their own.
 * - Business System adds team training and a first month of Keep It Running,
 *   so it is clearly cheaper than buying the parts (PACKAGE_VALUE).
 * Competitor check behind it: docs/maz-works/PRICE-AUDIT-2026-10.md.
 * Approved by Maz (2 Oct) on top: a UK price match (PRICE_MATCH), one-day
 * set-ups no longer sold on their own (free inside packages, £49 each for
 * more), and Extra automation down from £145 to £99.
 *
 * AI (Maz, 27 Sep): may be used behind the scenes to build or run things, but
 * is never advertised or sold as an offer. No 'AI assistant' or 'AI agent' copy.
